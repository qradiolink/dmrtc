DMR tier III trunking controller for MMDVM
====

This program attempts to implement a DMR tier III trunked radio controller. Only a subset of ETSI TS 102 361-4 is implemented currently, with most focus on amateur radio features.
This software is licenced under the GPL v3 and is primarily intended for amateur and educational use.
This software is intended to work together with DMRGateway, MMDVMHost-SDR, MMDVM-SDR and QRadioLink in order to create a DMR tier III radio site.

Requirements
====

- Qt 5.14 with GUI, network and widgets support.
- libconfig
- liblog4cpp
- Installing build dependencies on Debian 11 Bullseye: 

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install liblog4cpp5v5 libconfig++9v5 libconfig++-dev qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev libqt5core5a libqt5gui5 libqt5network5
</pre>


Building the software
-----

- Clone the Github repository into a directory of your choice
- Change directory to where you have cloned or unzipped the code
- Run qmake to generate the Makefile
- Run make (with the optional -j flag)

<pre>
$ git clone https://codeberg.org/qradiolink/dmrtc
$ cd dmrtc/
$ git checkout master
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build/
$ qmake ..
$ make
</pre>


Running the controller
----

- To run it with the GUI interface, simply execute drmtc.

<pre>
$ ./dmrtc
</pre>

- To run it in console, without the GUI interface, start it with the "-h" flag:

<pre>
$ ./dmrtc -h
</pre>

- The configuration file is located at $HOME/.config/dmrtc/dmrtc.cfg (see dmrtc.cfg.example)
- The list of DMR ids must be created at $HOME/.config/dmrtc/DMRIds.dat (CSV file with id, callsign and name, format by radioid.net )
- The log file is written at $HOME/.config/dmrtc/dmrtc.log
